    <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love</h1>

    <p>Happy birthday, baby. I miss you, and I love you. I’m so incredibly proud of you. Today is your special day, and I hope you feel how special you truly are because you’ve given me so much. You’ve given me endless love and unwavering support. You’ve given me purpose and a deep desire to be better for you, in every aspect of my life.</p>

    <p>In both Deen and Dunya, you’ve pushed me to be the best version of myself, and I can’t thank you enough for that. I truly hope I can make you as happy as you’ve made me, and that you feel as special as you make me feel. You have the most beautiful smile that lights up my world. Your laugh is contagious, and I don’t think I will ever hear a sound as sweet as that one. Your presence nourishes my soul, and I can never get enough of it.</p>

    <p>I want you to feel as special as you are to me, and I will commit my whole life to making that happen. To me, your presence is greater than the sun. You illuminate my perception of reality the way lightning strikes on a dark night, lighting up the world for that brief moment. No matter where I may be in this world, whether in the depths of the ocean or at the desolate peaks of the mountains, my heart yearns for you as if you’re home. Because you are home.</p>

    <p>Home is where Uroosa is. If the emotion of joy could be personified, it would be in you. If you were a star, the night would cease to exist, for you would burn a thousand times brighter than the sun. You are a mirror for all that is beautiful in the world. Or perhaps, all things beautiful in this world are a mirror for you? I can’t tell, but my definition of grace and beauty has changed since you’ve cemented yourself in my life.</p>

    <p>If my soul were a garden, you’d be the sunshine that gives it life. If my soul were a forest, you’d be the river that cuts through it, providing nourishment for every tree and animal. When we went to Kariya Park today and saw the two ducks posing, I thought of us. When the dude duck fought off the other dude duck to protect his duck wife, I thought of us too.</p>

    <p>I’ve been to Kariya Park before, but it was never as beautiful as it was today, simply because your presence complemented it like never before. The sun shone brighter today and kissed my skin warmer than ever before. Why? Because of you. It had to be because of you.</p>

    <p>I don’t say these things lightly; this comes straight from my heart. Every atom that makes up my body holds your heart and carries a love for you that no words could fully explain. No one on this earth could quantify how much I yearn for you.</p>

    <p>My heart beats to your tune. The synapses in my brain fire in accordance with you. Every breath I take is tied to you. I’m having withdrawals. I look at you and think, “I need to be better.” I need to be better with my deen, my character, and especially financially so I can take care of you and be there for you. I need to be better so that we can have a wonderful life together in this world and the next. You light a fire in me when it comes to this, and I’ve never felt more motivated in my life. You are the driving factor.</p>

    <p>Happy birthday, my love. I promise to make every birthday for you better than the last. You're my baby, now and always. I’m always gonna be here for you. I’m always gonna be in your corner. I love you like crazy, beyond quantifiable means.</p>
