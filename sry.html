        <h1>Uroosa,</h1>
        <p>I’m sorry, I know what I did wasn’t nice or okay. It was mean of me. I know I'm a little clingy sometimes where I get really irritated and frustrated when we don’t call or talk in a while, and with wedding preparations and other commitments that come with it, I know we’re both really busy so it happens.</p>

        <p>I know when your mom was gone you held it down and you had a lot of responsibility to shoulder, I’m very proud of you and you did amazing. I’m sorry I was being difficult sometimes and adding to your burdens instead of taking them away.</p>

        <p>You really make me happy and I’m extremely happy that you’re in my life. I know I apologize too much sometimes, and I don’t want it to be a thing where I apologize so much where my apologies don’t mean anything. I truly am sorry though, but I promise to show my sorry through my actions by doing better and being more understanding.</p>

        <p>All I want from this point on is to be a great husband and a great father, and every moment I’m alive is a moment where I improve. I want to improve spiritually, emotionally, and financially. I promise I will. You’re the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I’m going to cherish you and work on making you happy for the rest of my life.</p>

        <p>I love you baby, I love you more and more as every second goes by. Your existence is the very nourishment my soul needs to thrive. Your smile is like the reflection of the very moon. I yearn for you, constantly, eternally, and deeply. In my mind flowers grow wherever you step foot.</p>

        <p>I want to take pictures and videos of you for the rest of my life and capture all the beautiful memories we’re gonna make together. We’re gonna travel together, grow together, learn together, and keep on growing closer to each other. I’m gonna do better I promise. You’re my forever and always baby, I love you now and forever, you’ll always be my baby.</p>

        <p><strong>Yours always,</strong></p>
        <p>Junaid</p>
