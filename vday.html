            <p>Hey baby, happy valentines day. I know last year I didn't really do much for valentines day, because one day isn't enough for me to love you, but I still want to make you feel special. I know you're going through a lot and I see how hard you're working. I know it's overwhelming and tiring, yet you still do what you need to get done. I'm forever proud of you, now and forever. I love you and I find myself still falling for you. I wanted to give you something in person and to be honest I was a little busy so I couldn't get to it, but I was working on something else for you too. You'll see it on the next page. I'm so proud of you and I love you, I'm gonna keep doing everything I can to be the best husband and father I could possibly be and give you and our family the life you guys deserve. I'm still gonna surprise you with something, but I wanted to give you something now.</p>
